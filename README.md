# biomech_2d_kinematics
This repository houses MATLAB scripts related to solving 2D kinematic problems (e.g., projectile motion). 

# kinematics_projectile_motion_1
This script calculates position, velocity, and acceleration as continuous variables for a projectile. The projectile is launched from a given height with a given velocity and no launch angle. Air resistance and assistance are considered negligible in this code. Initial height (position_y(1)) can be changed at line 11 and horizontal velocity (velocity_x(1)) can be changed at line 15.

# kinematics_projectile_motion_2
This script finds the minimum horizontal velocity needed for a projectile to travel a specified horizontal distance. The projectile is launched from a given height with no launch angle. Air resistance and assistance are considered negligible in this code. Distance to be cleared can be changed at line 8 and initial height (position_y(1)) can be changed at line 15.
